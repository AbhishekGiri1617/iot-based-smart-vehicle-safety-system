In this modern era, transportation is becoming as one of the important need of human. Though it has numerous needs, we face lot of problem in it which might cost human life. This paper/ project deals with problem which cause accident and also to ensure safety and security of the person present in the vehicle or is driving the vehicle. It deals with vibration sensor to detect the accident. If the vibration sensor detects the accident, an alert message is sent to the official person which give GPS location in form of latitude and longitude. A mechanism involves confirming the assurance of locked seat belt and ensures that until the seat belts are not locked, the vehicle engine would not start. And it also ensure the driver is not drunk through an alcohol sensor. The alcohol senor is used to found the drunken driver only if driver is not get dunked then only the ignition will start. The eye blink sensor detects the drowsiness of the driver and give alert using the buzzer. It also deploys a proximity sensor in order to avoid the collision. The automotive proximity sensor are deployed inside the car to find out the interruption in path. All these status will be updated on the internet using the concept of Internet of Things and the same will also be deployed on an app. Through this, driver safety is ensured through the automotive mechanism.
