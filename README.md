# SmartVehicleSafetySytem
In this modern era, transportation is emerging as one of the important need of human. Though it has numerous needs, weface lot of problem in it which might cost human life. This paper deals with problem which cause accident and also to
ensure safety and security of the person present in the vehicle or is driving the vehicle. It deals with vibration sensor to
detect the accident. If the vibration sensor detects the accident, an alert message is sent to the official person which give
GPS location. A mechanism involves confirming the assurance of locked seat belt and ensures that until the seat belts are
not locked, the vehicle engine would not start. And it also ensure the driver is not drunk through an alcohol sensor. The
alcohol senor is used to found the drunken driver only if driver is not drunk then only the ignition will start. The eye
blink sensor detects the drowsiness of the driver and give alert using the buzzer. It also deploys a proximity sensor in
order to avoid the collision. The automotive proximity sensor are deployed inside the car to find out the interruption in
path. All these status will be updated on the internet using the concept of Internet of Things and the same will also be
deployed on an app. Through this, driver safety is ensured through the automotive mechanism.

## Proposed System
The proposed system makes use of an embedded system based on GSM Technology and Internet of Things. To avoid the
accident, the automotive proximity sensor are deployed inside the car to find out the interruption in path. And to
ensure safety even after the accident an alert mechanism is governed which uses a GPS system to get position of the
vehicle and it sends to authorized person when the vehicle face the accident which is sensed by a vibration sensor. A
gas senor is used to found the drunken driver only if driver is not get dunked then only the ignition get start, the eye blink
sensor detects the drowsiness of the driver and give alert using the buzzer. All these status will be updated on the portal
using Internet of Things. 

## Methodology
The embedded technology is the prime technology used here under the wireless as main domain; to achieve the concept
here we are using ARDUINO UNO as the prime controller which uses ATMEGA-328 controller which is driven by 5V
DC supply, the coding is done through the ARDUINO IDE and it is also dumped to the controller through the same IDE,
the Embedded C language is used as the coding language, Arduino comprises of 12 digital pins, 6 analog pins, 1 5v, 3
ground pins and one serial pin. The digital pins can be used as the serial pins using the software serial communication,
here we are using totally 5 sensor in which the alcohol and vibration sensors are used as the analog sensors while the eye
blink, proximity, and the seatbelt/helmet sensors are used as digital sensor. Each and every sensor consists of a 5V and
ground pin which is given to the Arduino’s 5V and ground pin, the input pin is given to the corresponding Arduino’s
input pin which is declared in the coding, since the alcohol sensor and the vibration sensor must met certain threshold so
we are using that sensors as analog sensors which is connected to the corresponding analog as such like declared in the
code.

Here the eye blink sensor is used to detect the drowsiness of the driver; the proximity sensor is used to detect a very close
obstacle present in from of the vehicle, the alcohol sensor senses whether the driver consumes the alcohol[9], the seat
belt/helmet sensor detect whether the driver is wearing the seat belt/helmet, the vibration sensor detects the accident of
the vehicle. Here the 5V DC motor is used to indicate the vehicle’s wheel is running or not, the buzzer is used for alarm
indication, the GPS is used to get the location, the GSM is used to send the message the IOT is used to publish the data in
cloud.

## Future Scope
The Proposed System can be modified by making use of concept of Big data and GPS for seeking help from nearest
Remote Station in case of Accident.
